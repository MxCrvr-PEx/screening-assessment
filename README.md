Screening & Assessment

This project consists of two questionnaires (namely the Drug Abuse Screening Test & the Alcohol Dependence Scale) developed by Harvey SKinner in 1982, which is used to identify if an individual has a 'problem' and the extent as to how severe the problem has become. It also reccommends advice and treatment options based on the individual's score.
